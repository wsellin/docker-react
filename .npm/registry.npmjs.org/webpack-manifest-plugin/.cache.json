[![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/nwjs/nw.js.svg)](https://gitter.im/webpack-manifest-plugin#)\n\n\nWebpack plugin for generating an asset manifest.\n\n> NOTE: The following is related to the next major version of `webpack-manifest-plugin`, please check https://github.com/danethurber/webpack-manifest-plugin/blob/1.x/README.md for `v1` documentation\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-manifest-plugin\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nIn your `webpack.config.js`\n\n```javascript\nvar ManifestPlugin = require('webpack-manifest-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    // ...\n    plugins: [\n      new ManifestPlugin()\n    ]\n};\n```\n\nThis will generate a `manifest.json` file in your root output directory with a mapping of all source file names to their corresponding output file, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mods/alpha.js\": \"mods/alpha.1234567890.js\",\n  \"mods/omega.js\": \"mods/omega.0987654321.js\"\n}\n```\n\n\n## API:\n\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  output: {\n    publicPath\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new ManifestPlugin(options)\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### `options.fileName`\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `manifest.json`\n\nThe manifest filename in your output directory.\n\n### `options.publicPath`\n\nType: `String`\nDefault: `output.publicPath`\n\nA path prefix that will be added to values of the manifest.\n\n### `options.basePath`\n\nType: `String`\n\nA path prefix for all keys. Useful for including your output path in the manifest.\n\n\n### `options.writeToFileEmit`\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nIf set to `true` will emit to build folder and memory in combination with `webpack-dev-server`\n\n\n### `options.seed`\n\nType: `Object`<br>\nDefault: `{}`\n\nA cache of key/value pairs to used to seed the manifest. This may include a set of [custom key/value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json) pairs to include in your manifest, or may be used to combine manifests across compilations in [multi-compiler mode](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/tree/master/examples/multi-compiler). To combine manifests, pass a shared seed object to each compiler's ManifestPlugin instance.\n\n### `options.filter`\n\nType: `Function(FileDescriptor): Boolean`\n\nFilter out files. [FileDescriptor typings](#filedescriptor)\n\n\n### `options.map`\n\nType: `Function(FileDescriptor): FileDescriptor`\n\nModify files details before the manifest is created. [FileDescriptor typings](#filedescriptor)\n\n### `options.sort`\n\nType: `Function(FileDescriptor): number`\n\nSort files before they are passed to `generate`. [FileDescriptor typings](#filedescriptor)\n\n### `options.generate`\n\nType: `Function(Object, FileDescriptor, string[]): Object`<br>\nDefault: `(seed, files, entrypoints) => files.reduce((manifest, {name, path}) => ({...manifest, [name]: path}), seed)`\n\nCreate the manifest. It can return anything as long as it's serialisable by `JSON.stringify`.
