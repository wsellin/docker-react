I loved the features once I finally worked out how to use each one, but they can't even call crop \"crop\". Instead you have to Google \"How do I crop in Inkskape\", only to find there are three different ways to \"crop\", one of which is the way most people think of crop, but it's still not quite the same. Why not just have a \"crop\" feature with a standard draw a box and hit \"crop\"? Instead you have to go through about 6 processes, whilst following a step by step guide on Google, to get something resembling cropping in a normal program.\n\nIf cropping was the only feature with a problem I would have put up with it, but I found myself going through a similar process whenever I wanted to do something that is intuitive in Photoshop. \n\nEven worse, if I didn't use a feature for a few weeks I would have to look up again in Google for a refresher on how to do it, because nothing is very intuitive in this program.\n\nNice features, terrible naming conventions, Googling for instructions is easier than using the help files.",
